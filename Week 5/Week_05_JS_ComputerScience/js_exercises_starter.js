// ================= VARIABLES  & STRING INTERPOLATION =================

// Exercise 1: The Fortune Teller
//
// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?
//
// Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
// Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

// Exercise 2: The Age Calculator
//
// Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!
//
// Store the current year in a variable.
// Store your birth year in a variable.
// Calculate your 2 possible ages based on the stored values.
// Output them to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN", substituting the values.

// Exercise 3: The Lifetime Supply Calculator
//
// Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
//
// Store your current age into a variable.
// Store a maximum age into a variable.
// Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
// Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
// Output the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".

// ================= CONDITIONALS =================


// Exercise 4: What number's bigger?

// Write a function named greaterNum that:
// takes 2 arguments, both numbers.
// returns whichever number is the greater (higher) number.
// Call that function 2 times with different number pairs, and log the output to make sure it works (e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10.").

// Exercise 5: The World Translator

// Write a function named helloWorld that:
// takes 1 argument, a language code (e.g. "es", "de", "en")
// returns "Hello, World" for the given language, for atleast 3 languages. It should default to returning English.
// Call that function for each of the supported languages and log the result to make sure it works.

// Write a function named assignGrade that:
// takes 1 argument, a number score.
// returns a grade for the score, either "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F".
// Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.
